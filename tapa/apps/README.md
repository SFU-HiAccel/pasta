This directory contains multiple small example TAPA designs. We provide a reference `.ini` file for each design that includes the binding to physical HBM/DDR ports. To synthesize the design, you could either use the provided `run_tapa.sh` script or through CMake. For more details, refer to our [documentation](https://tapa.readthedocs.io/en/release/)

For large and complex designs, refer to the `tapa/regression` directory.
